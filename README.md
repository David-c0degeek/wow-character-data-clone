## Options

| Parameter              | Description                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-WowRoot`             | Path to WoW installation. Default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft`                                                             |
| `-BackupTarget`        | Create a timestamped ZIP backup of the target character before cloning.                                                                   |

| `-DryRun`              | Show what would be done without copying anything.                                                                                         |
| `-VerboseAccounts`     | Print full account/realm/character tree before picking.                                                                                   |

## Example

Clone settings from Mage on Account #1 â†’ Priest on Account #2, with backup:

```powershell
.\charclone.ps1 -BackupTarget
```

Dry-run to preview actions:

```powershell
.\charclone.ps1 -DryRun -VerboseAccounts
```

## Notes

* Source and target must exist under `WTF\Account\<Account>\<Realm>\<Character>`.
* WoW only creates character folders after logging into the toon **at least once**.
* Works with Classic Era, Classic Hardcore/SoD, and Retail automatically.
